## üìä Dataset Used
The project utilizes TLC Trip Record Data, which includes yellow and green taxi trip records with comprehensive details. Access the data [here](https://github.com/cyber-prags/Uber-analytics-Data-Engineering-Project/tree/main/Data). More information on the dataset can be found on the [NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission website](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) and the [Data Dictionary](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf).

## Data Model
We developed a data model to structure and analyze the relationships within our dataset:

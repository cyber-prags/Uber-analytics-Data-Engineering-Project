## 🚀 Introduction
This project harnesses Uber's extensive datasets through advanced tools and technologies including GCP Storage, Python, Compute Instance, Mage Data Pipeline Tool, BigQuery, and Looker Studio. The goal is to extract meaningful insights and provide a comprehensive view of Uber's operational dynamics.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** – The primary programming language for data analysis.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):**
  - `Google Storage` – For secure, scalable data storage.
  - `Compute Instance` – Delivers high-performance computing.
  - `BigQuery` – Enables fast, SQL-like data querying.
  - `Looker Studio` – Used to create interactive dashboards.
- **Mage.ai** – A modern data pipeline tool for efficient ETL processes. [Learn More](https://www.mage.ai/)
